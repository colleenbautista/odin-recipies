This project is an introductory task designed to help me get familiar with HTML by building a simple recipe page.
As I work on this project, I will learn how to structure a webpage using HTML elements, including headings, paragraphs, images, and links.
I will also get the chance to practice organizing content into sections and creating lists for ingredients and instructions. By the end of 
this project, I will have demonstrated my ability to use HTML tags, format content, and create a well-organized and accessible webpage, which
will be an essential foundation for more advanced web development tasks.
